NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::AppendExternalData - Append data to gathered files

VERSION
    version 0.003

SYNOPSIS
       [AppendExternalData]
       source_dir = pod       ; required
       prune_source_dir = 1   ; default

DESCRIPTION
    This Dist::Zilla plugin appends files in a directory to files being
    gathered for the distribution.

    When using this plugin, be thoughtful about the order in which you want
    files to be modified. For example, if you are appending Pod, it makes a
    big difference if you append before or after a plugin like "PodWeaver".
    If you list this plugin first, the Pod will be appended before weaving
    and the added Pod will wind up in the middle of the generated Pod. If
    this plugin is listed last, the Pod will be appended after weaving and
    will follow the generated Pod from "PodWeaver".

    If appending a "__DATA__" section, be sure to put this plugin last among
    plugins that modify your files.

ATTRIBUTES
  source_dir (REQUIRED)
    This is the directory containing data to append. Files within this
    directory that have the same relative names as modules and executables
    will have their contents appended. E.g. if "source_dir" is pod, then
    pod/lib/Foo.pm will be appended to lib/Foo.pm. If a gathered file does
    not match a file in the source directory or vice-versa, it will not
    altered and is not considered an error.

  prune_source_dir
    This is a boolean that indicates whether the "source_dir" should also be
    pruned from the distribution. The default is 1.

CAVEAT
    This is a proof-of-concept and does not yet have any tests of its
    behavior.
